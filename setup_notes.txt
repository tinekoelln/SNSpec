# Single SNe Python Environment Setup Notes

## Folder setup
- Created project directory at ~/code/single_sne
- Inside, created subfolders: src/single_sne, scripts, tests
  → These separate the main code, helper scripts, and tests.

## Virtual Environment
- Created a virtual environment with:
    /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 -m venv .venv
- Activated it:
    source .venv/bin/activate
- Verified correct interpreter with:
    which python
    python -V
- Why: isolates dependencies per project, avoids version conflicts.
It's important to keep the environment inside of the project folder, not clobally, so that deleting the folder removes everything related to the project in question. 

## Running scripts
- Wrote first Python script (scripts/hello.py)
- Ran it directly with `python scripts/hello.py`
- Output shows interpreter path and confirms venv works

## Actually using scientific packages: 
install core scientific packages via
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install numpy matplotlib astropy pandas scipy specutils scienceplots  #add whatever other packages are needed
Always freeze dependencies via
 python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt 
this way, anyone (including future me) can recreate the environment with python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

##Creating a project CLI

CLI stands for Command-Line interface, it's the part of a program one can run and control from the terminal. This makes the project behave as a real tool instead
of several disconnected scripts. One can then pass arguments (filenames, options, filters) from the terminal without having to edit the script each and every time
It also helps structure the project cleanly (src/single_sne/ holds logic, scripts/ just calls it). Lastly, if I ever share the code, it can be easily run with one
command. 

To make the package installable, one can do the following. First, create a minimal pyproject.toml:
cat > pyproject.toml << 'TOML'
[project]
name = "single-sne"
version = "0.0.1"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = []

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
TOML

#Step 2: Install package in editable mode: pip install -e .

## convert-fnu CLI command
- Created new module snspec.py with to_fnu_mjy()
- Added subcommand: single-sne convert-fnu --infile ... --outfile ...
- Tested conversion using spec.txt -> spec_mjy.txt


##using micro: CONTROL S to save, cmd S does not work
